# lavalink-rs

An API Wrapper for `lavalink`. Compatible with all `tokio 1.x` based discord crates or `asyncio` based discord python libraries.

If you have questions, you can get support in the [serenity](https://discord.gg/serenity-rs), [lavalink](https://discord.gg/2rpnXNfRRU) or [hikari](https://discord.gg/hikari)
discord servers, or by opening an issue in the [gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/vicky5124/lavalink-rs).

Documentation for the library can be found [here for rust](https://docs.rs/lavalink-rs) or [here for python](https://vicky5124.github.io/lavalink-rs/lavalink_rs.html).
